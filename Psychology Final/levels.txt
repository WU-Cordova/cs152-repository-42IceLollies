1) Hypothalamus - regulates body temperature, hunger, thirst, circadian rythms, feel reward/release horomones
- It's 10:30. Time to start reminding your human that it's almost time for that lunch break they have in 1 1/2 hours!
- Hypothalamus:13, cerrebellum: 8, frontal lobe:7, brainstem:5, Amygdala:4

2) Temporal Lobe - used to process sound & recognize words/understand sound - also allowed in visual memory (recognize faces, etc)
- Siousxie Sioux and Robert Smith walk up beside your human and you're almost too busy gaping at their hair and wondering how much
 hairspray they use culmatively every year to realize they're talking your human. Quick, which part of the brain do you need to activate?
-in explanation, say occipital lobe is also valid in the case that your human lipreads
- Temporal lobe:13, Occipital Lobe:12, Thalamus:10, Frontal lobe:7, Cerrebellum:6, 

3) Hippocampus - learning and memory, if damaged, cannot retain new facts/memories
- Your human just walked into a room full of people whose names they're going to have to learn. Either you're going to have to
get out something to write with or route all this new information somewhere to store it in memory.
- Hippocampus: 13, occipital lobe:12, amygdala:10, temporal lobe:9, frontal lobe:10, thalamus:6

4) Amygdala - memory consolidation, emotion (emotional extremes), formation of emotional memories, also play role in recognizing faces
- The human's friend just brought them flowers. A lot of strong emotions coming in on your console right now, which part of the brain 
will you allocate this memory to for storage?
-Amygdala: 13, frontal lobe: 12, Hypothalamus:9, hippocampus: 6,

5) Cerrebellum - Used to learn/perform coordinated movements (like riding a bike)- nonverbal- plays a role in paying attention, perception of time 
                impaired easily, such as with alcohol
-  It's been a while since your human has ridden a bike with all this icy winter weather but there must be information stored away somewhere
in this brain to help them out.
- cerrebellum: 13, parietal lobe:11, frontal lobe:9, occipital lobe:6

6) Frontal Lobe - plan and initiate movements, social/emotional processing and attention involved in working memory & retrieving/storing memories
                speaking, planning, judging, abstract thinking, personality 
- Your human looks at the list of homework they have in their planner. It's far too much to finish tonight, they're going to need to decide 
which is the highest priority and make a plan to complete the rest later. 
-Frontal lobe: 13, 

7) Thalamus - take in sensory information related to seeing hearing touching and tasting - pretty much a relay, also regulates sleep and alertness
- Today, the human is going to the amusement park with their friends. There's going to be a lot of sensory information coming in which you
need to sort out and send to the right place. 
-thalamus:13, parietal:10, occipital:10, temporal:10, frontal:5

8) Occipital Lobe - visual perception - participates in some forms of short term visual memory
- Your human just got their driver's license so now they're going to be doing a lot more driving. All that visual information coming information
coming in is going to need to be sent somewhere for processing quickly.
-Occipital: 13, thalamus:9, frontal lobe:7, 

9) Brainstem - basic functions, breathing, feeling pain, sleep, ArOuSaL y'know, that stuff
- The night time is when you get a break from your job and let the brain do it's own thing but you need to appoint someone to keep your human's
basic functions such as breathing going while they're asleep.
-brainstem:13, cerebellum:7, hypothalamus:5

10) Parietal Lobe - sensing touch and spacial processing 
- Your human is taking a gymnastics class! You learn that its essential to be able to know where your body is in space to do all those fancy
flips. Where might you find a brain function to help with this?
-parietal:13, cerebellum:10, frontal:5, hippocampus:4
